# My Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to a variety of problems from the competitive programming platform, Codeforces. The solutions are written in Python 3.

This project serves as a log of my progress and a portfolio of my problem-solving skills. Each file is named to correspond to the problem it solves.

### Key Learnings

Solving these problems has helped me strengthen my skills in:

* **Problem-Solving & Logic:** Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.

* **Algorithmic Thinking:** Implementing efficient algorithms to handle constraints on time and memory.

* **Python Proficiency:** Gaining a deeper understanding of Python's data structures and built-in functions.
